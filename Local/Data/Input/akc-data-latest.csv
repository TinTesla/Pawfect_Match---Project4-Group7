Affenpinscher,"The Affen’s apish look has been described many ways. They’ve been called “monkey dogs” and “ape terriers.” The French say diablotin moustachu (“mustached little devil”), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. “This isn’t a breed you train,” a professional dog handler tells us, “He’s like a human. You befriend him.” The dense, harsh coat is described as “neat but shaggy” and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs. The Affenpinscher: loyal, curious, and famously amusing; this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it’s the Affenpinscher’s apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.","Confident, Famously Funny, Fearless",148,22.86,29.21,3.17514659,4.535923700000001,12.0,15.0,Toy Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.8,Easy Training,1.0,Outgoing

Their huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland’s punishing terrain.The Afghan Hound is a special breed for special people.

The breed largely survived, particularly in the southern states, due to its ability to bring down and catch feral pigs.The breed we know as the American Bulldog was originally known by many different names before the name American Bulldog became the standard. In different parts of the South he was known as the White English Southern Bulldog, but most commonly just “bulldog.” The breed was not called a bulldog because of a certain look, but because they did real bulldog work.

The breed’s scenting ability is uncanny; it’s said that among dogs only the Bloodhound’s nose is more accurate. Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks in a loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections, they are steadfastly loyal. Among the most appealing of the AKC breeds, the endearing and instantly recognizable Basset Hound is a perennial favorite of dog lovers all over the world. This low-slung and low-key hound can be sometimes stubborn, but is always charming.","Charming, Patient, Low-Key",39,38.1,38.1,18.143694800000002,29.48350405,12.0,13.0,Hound Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.4,Occasional,0.2,Couch Potato,0.4,Independent,0.8,Friendly
Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound,"Hailing from Germany, the Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound is the Bayerischer Gebirgsschweisshund in its native German. The breed’s most notable trait is its outstanding “cold nose” tracking ability. His nose is so acute, he can distinguish between the injured game he is hunting and other animals of the same species. This somewhat lightweight, active, medium-sized breed is devoted to his owner, but can be reserved with strangers. He is not a kennel dog and prefers to be around his human family. The Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound is calm and balanced, devoted to its owner, and reserved with strangers. He is a sound, self-assured, unafraid, biddable dog, neither shy nor aggressive.","Loyal, Versatile, Reserved with Strangers",,43.18,52.07,16.78291769,29.937096420000003,12.0,15.0,Foundation Stock Service,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.8,Regularly,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.6,Agreeable,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Beagle,"There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15 inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and “big for their inches,” as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle’s fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a broad head.A breed described as “merry” by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable—all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime. Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and—thanks to its pleading expression—cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing.","Friendly, Curious, Merry",6,33.02,38.1,5.8967008100000005,13.6077711,10.0,15.0,Hound Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.6,Agreeable,0.8,Friendly
Bearded Collie,"Standing 20 to 22 inches at the shoulder and covered head to tail in a shaggy double coat, Beardies bear a passing resemblance to another British favorite, the Old English Sheepdog. Beneath the coats, Beardies are the more lean and angular of the two. The lavish facial hair shouldn’t obscure the characteristic expression: a dreamy, faraway gaze.These rambunctious comics can be a handful—but mostly, Beardies are approximately 50 pounds of heart, energy, and laughter. Well-socialized Beardies will get on nicely with other animals and kids. They bore easily, and training must be kept interesting. Outdoorsy families looking for a sturdy dog to share an uptempo lifestyle will never find a more affectionate and amusing sidekick. A boisterous and charismatic droving dog from Scotland, the shaggy-coated Bearded Collie (“Beardie” to his friends) enjoys outdoor exercise in all weather. Bred to be independent decision-makers, they can be willful but are always friendly.","Smart, Bouncy, Charismatic",127,50.8,55.88,20.41165665,24.947580350000003,12.0,14.0,Herding Group,0.8,Daily Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.4,Independent,1.0,Outgoing
Beauceron,"Beaucerons are muscular, rugged, and large, standing as high as 27.5 inches at the shoulder, and yet graceful and in all ways balanced. Their dark black coats feature handsome squirrel-red accents, including the red feet that give the breed its French nickname Bas-Rouge (“red stockings”). They’re also seen in a black-gray-tan coat. The long head is well chiseled, and the dark brown eyes project an expression breed fanciers describe as frank and confident. They’re not for novice owners, who might end up being owned by their dominant dog instead of the other way around. That said, well-trained and socialized Beaucerons are levelheaded watchdogs and guardians, especially good with the young, the small, and the defenseless. The Beauceron is imposing and powerful, but also remarkably smart, spirited, and a versatile herder—imagine a Border Collie’s brain in a 100-pound body. They are especially beloved by women as a dashing but sensitive companion and protector.","Gentle, Faithful, Obedient",124,60.96,69.85,31.751465900000003,49.895160700000005,10.0,12.0,Herding Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,1.0,Frequent,1.0,Needs Lots of Activity,0.8,Easy Training,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Bedlington Terrier,"Bedlingtons are lithe, energetic Englishmen. The crisp, curly coat; arched back; tasseled ears; scimitar-shaped tail; and fleecy, pear-shaped head are identifying features of this one-of-a-kind breed. As the curvy contours indicate, there’s sighthound—Whippet, most likely—in their family tree. Bedlingtons move with a light, springy step and when roused to pursuit can run like the wind.Rollicking, charming, and full of fun, Bedlingtons want most to be their family’s center of attention and are known to be protective of loved ones. For an active family looking for a no-shedding, lively, and loyal companion, the search might end here.

Belgian Laekenois,"Of the four closely-related Belgian herders—the Belgian Sheepdog, Malinois, Tervuren, and Laekenois—the Laekenois is the rarest. This strong and sturdy dog is distinguished from his brethren by a rough, tousled coat that comes in shades of red or fawn or in grayish tones. The blackening around the muzzle points up the expression of keen watchfulness shining from the dark almond-shaped eyes.The Belgian Laekenois is protective of his master and property. Although observant with strangers, the breed is affectionate and friendly with those he knows well. The Laekenois coat requires regular brushing and occasional bathing, and as a working dog, it needs daily exercise. Strong, agile and full of life, the Belgian Laekenois (pronounced ""Lak-in-wah"") is one of four native dogs of Belgium. Although similar in body and temperament to the Malinois, Shepherd and Tervuren, the Laekenois differs in coat color, texture and length, as well as region of origin.","Affectionate, Alert, Intelligent",,55.88,66.04,24.947580350000003,29.48350405,10.0,12.0,Miscellaneous Class,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.8,Regularly,0.8,Energetic,0.8,Easy Training,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Belgian Malinois,"Belgian Malinois are squarely built, proud, and alert herders standing 22 to 26 inches. Strong and well-muscled, but more elegant than bulky, there’s an honest, no-frills look about them, as befit dogs built to work hard for their feed. A breed hallmark is the proud carriage of the head. Coat colors range from a rich fawn to mahogany. The black ears and mask accentuate bright, questioning eyes the color of dark Belgian chocolate.If you have ever seen a Mal perform an obedience routine, you know firsthand what a smart and eager breed this is. Problems set in, though, when this people-oriented dog is underemployed and neglected. Exercise, and plenty of it, preferably side by side with their adored owner, is key to Mal happiness. The smart, confident, and versatile Belgian Malinois is a world-class worker who forges an unbreakable bond with his human partner. To deny a Mal activity and the pleasure of your company is to deprive him of his very reasons for being.","Confident, Smart, Hardworking",43,55.88,66.04,18.143694800000002,36.287389600000004,14.0,16.0,Herding Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.8,Easy Training,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Belgian Sheepdog,"The stirring silhouette of a Belgian Sheepdog conveys both elegance and muscular determination. A handsome feature of the breed is the exceedingly proud carriage of the head and neck. A male might stand 26 inches at the shoulder; females are smaller. The dark eyes sparkle with a questioning intelligence, and the black coat is abundant, from the neck’s “collarette” to the “breeches” of the hindquarters. In all ways, Belgian Sheepdogs are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.In any sport or activity, a Belgian will always give 100 percent. In turn, owners tend to form a special bond with their eager workaholics. As one devotee puts it, Belgians “inspire such intense loyalty because they themselves live and love with such great passion.” The Belgian Sheepdog is a highly trainable herder whose versatility and intelligence is the stuff of canine legend. This is a breed built for hard work, and plenty of it. These sensitive souls crave human companionship and abhor neglect.","Bright, Watchful, Serious-Minded",125,55.88,66.04,20.41165665,34.01942775,12.0,14.0,Herding Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.8,Easy Training,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Belgian Tervuren,"The Belgian Tervuren is characterized by a straight and abundant coat, an elegant but muscular frame, a proudly carried head, an alert and intelligent demeanor, and an insatiable work drive. The Tervuren’s coat furnishings, like the sporty “collarette” around the neck, are more profuse on males, who run larger than females.“Their intelligence and high activity level can be a challenge for the less creative individual who may not understand the breed’s need to work,” warns one longtime owner. But don’t get the idea that Tervurens are grim, mechanical worker drones. In fact, this breed takes real delight in their ability to master any task, and owners say a mischievous sense of humor is at work whenever Tervurens outsmart their beloved human. The elegant, agile Belgian Tervuren is a bright and self-assured herding dog of medium size, known to be affectionate and possessive with loved ones. Lots of hard work and challenging play is heaven for this tireless, do-it-all dog.","Courageous, Alert, Intelligent",106,55.88,66.04,20.41165665,34.01942775,12.0,14.0,Herding Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.8,Easy Training,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Bergamasco Sheepdog,"Beneath the one-of-a-kind coat is a large, muscular shepherd dog of ancient pedigree. But, since the coat is the breed’s hallmark, let’s take a close look. The Bergamasco Sheepdog has hair of three different textures that form naturally occurring loose mats, or “flocks” (strands of hair woven together, creating flat layers of felted hair), covering the body and legs. The flocks provide protection from the fierce cold and wild predators of the Italian Alps, the breed’s ancestral homeland.Bergamascos are bright, loyal, loving, and trainable—with a dash of mountain-dog independence. They take to watching over loved ones with a serene vigilance. Wary of strangers until properly introduced, Bergamascos are aggressive only as a last resort. Generally happy with kids and other animals, the low-maintenance and robustly healthy Bergamasco is much more than a show-stopping hairdo. Eager to please, smart, and stubbornly devoted to work, Bergamascos are patient but protective.","Independent, Sociable, Intelligent",187,55.88,59.69,25.85476509,38.10175908,13.0,15.0,Herding Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.2,Infrequent,0.4,Calm,0.6,Agreeable,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Berger Picard,"You can spot a Berger Picard a mile away thanks to his erect ears standing 4 to 5 inches high, a wavy fawn or brindle coat, and a strong tail that tapers to a distinctive J-hook. Males stand as high as 26 inches, and females as low as 21 inches. The eyes are dark and glistening, and the rectangular head is furnished with shaggy eyebrows, beard, and mustache— the very image of a sagacious and worldly Frenchman.The Berger Picard is an ideal companion for athletic owners. Their rugged constitution, agility, and boundless energy make them eager partners in all kinds of sports, games, and outdoor pastimes. Exercise is a must; prolonged idleness and neglect will likely lead these sensitive, super-smart dogs to destructive behavior. The Berger Picard is a lanky herding dog of strong bone and sturdy build. Picards spent centuries as take-charge independent problem-solvers, so early socialization and positive training are necessary to cope with their stubborn streak.","Loyal, Good-Natured, Observant",144,54.61,64.77,22.6796185,31.751465900000003,12.0,13.0,Herding Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.6,Seasonal,1.0,Needs Lots of Activity,0.8,Easy Training,0.6,Alert/Responsive
Bernese Mountain Dog,"The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over 27 inches at the shoulder. The thick, silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored: jet black, clear white, and rust. The distinctive markings on the coat and face are breed hallmarks and, combined with the intelligent gleam in the dark eyes, add to the Berner’s aura of majestic nobility. A hardy dog who thrives in cold weather, the Berner’s brain and brawn helped him multitask on the farms and pastures of Switzerland.Berners get along with the entire family and are particularly gentle with children, but they will often become more attached to one lucky human. Berners are imposing but not threatening, and they maintain an aloof dignity with strangers.

Alert and curious, Bichons make nice little watchdogs—but they are lovers, not fighters, and operate under the assumption that there are no strangers, just friends they haven’t met yet.

A lonely B&T will serenade the neighborhood with loud, mournful “music.” B&Ts can keep pace with the most active family, but they also can hog the sofa for hours on end. Hounds will be hounds: A passing squirrel can arouse B&T prey drive in no time flat, so a strong leash and sturdy fence are must-haves. B&Ts might be too much hound for the lifestyle of every owner.

They’re much taller when the huge, brick-shaped head is considered. The tousled, all-black coat is warm enough to allow BRTs to patrol some of the coldest habitable places on earth.

A large male can top out at 27 inches and 80 pounds; females are smaller. Blueticks are well-muscled but sleek and racy, never chunky or clumsy. The baying, bawling, and chopping bark of Blueticks might be cacophonous to some, but to coon hunters it’s the music of the night.The droopy-eared charm of Blueticks is irresistible. They crave affection and are deeply devoted to those who provide it. Blueticks have tremendous prey drive. Neglected, underemployed coonhounds with no outlet for their hardwired impulses can develop problem behaviors, like serenading the neighbors with loud, mournful “music.” The sleekly beautiful Bluetick Coonhound is a sweet and affectionate charmer who might enjoy snoozing in the shade, but in pursuit of quarry he is relentless, bold, and single-minded.

They would be ill-suited for people with a 9-5 workday. Bolos are an old breed, known by royals and noblemen in Roman times, and were given as precious gifts between the wealthy and powerful.

The wire coat can be grizzle and tan, blue and tan, wheaten, or red.Borders are described as “hard as nails” when working, but at home they’re good-tempered, affectionate, and trainable.

Beneath the luxurious silky coat, Borzoi construction follows the ancient Greyhound template.

Affectionate family dogs, Borzoi are nonetheless a bit too dignified to wholeheartedly enjoy a lot of roughhousing. The sight of a cat or squirrel on the run will quickly stir their pursuit instinct, and fenced-in running room is a must.

A luxurious beard and eyebrows accentuate an expression described as “frank and questioning.” Standing between 22 and 27 inches at the shoulder, Briards are burly and rugged but move with a nimble-footed gait.They possess traits common to many other herders: trainability, brains, a protective eye toward family (especially kids, whom they regard as their flock), and wariness with outsiders. These are large, tireless dogs—it is said that just two or three Briards can handle 700 head of sheep—and novice owners might be overwhelmed by their work drive and zest for life.

Broholmer,"A large, mastiff-type dog, the Broholmer is rectangular and strongly built with a wide, massive head. Around the year 1800, a Danish dog book described him as a very ordinary breed, especially around Copenhagen. His nickname was “the butcher’s dog,” as he was often seen lying at the doorsteps of butcher shops. He was a protector of the home and a herder and guard dog of cattle at the farm and in the city’s markets. Today, his size is the only thing that keeps intruders at bay. The Broholmer has a heart of gold, loves to snuggle, and always wants to be near you, though his preference is to sit on you. He is an excellent dog with children and other dogs, though because he seems to underestimate his size, supervision is recommended. This breed is also remarkably agile for his size and can do agility, fetch balls, and jump and catch frisbees. Anything you do, camping, hiking, picnicking, walks in the park, he will be more than happy to go along with you.

Brussels Griffon,"With this breed, you get a big personality in a 5-to-15-pound package. One look into his big, human-like eyes, and you’ll be smitten. Griffs come in four colors—red, black-and-reddish-brown (called belge), black and tan, and black—and in smooth coats (like a Pug) or rough coats (like a Schnauzer). Their black muzzle and whiskers earned them the nickname “bearded dogs” in old folk songs.The Griff’s big black eyes—described as “almost human”—coupled with a fringed beard and mustache covering his short muzzle, gives him the air of a worldly, French-speaking philosopher. The Griff’s body is thickset and sturdy, and he moves with the purposeful trot of a fellow who knows what he wants.Griffs are alert, sociable, and easily trained. Although playful and energetic, their small size and sensitive nature make them a poor choice as roughhousing playmates for kids. They have a low threshold for loneliness and will stick close to their special human, providing years of love and laughter. Tipping the scales at no more than 12 pounds, this human-like toy of complex character has enough personality for 10 ordinary dogs. A sensitive companion for discerning grownups, the Brussels Griffon is smart, devoted, and comically self-important.","Loyal, Alert, Curious",98,17.78,25.4,3.62873896,4.535923700000001,12.0,15.0,Toy Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.6,Agreeable,0.8,Friendly
Bull Terrier,"Bull Terriers are robust, big-boned terriers who move with a jaunty stride suggesting agility and power. The breed’s hallmark is a long, egg-shaped head with erect and pointed ears, and small, triangular eyes that glisten with good humor. Coats come in two types: white; and any other color (including an attractive brindle striping), either solid or with white markings. A well-made BT is the picture of muscular determination and balance. There are four keys to BT happiness: early socialization with dogs and people; firm but loving training; ample exercise; and lots of quality time with his adored humans. If these requirements are met, there is no more loyal, lovable, and entertaining companion. This is the ultimate “personality breed.” Among the most comical and mischievous citizens of dogdom, the Bull Terrier is playful and endearing, sometimes stubborn, but always devoted.

Bulldog,"You can’t mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all practically scream “I’m a Bulldog!” The coat, seen in a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won’t stop them from curling up in your lap, or at least trying to. But don’t mistake their easygoing ways for laziness—Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog’s short snout can cause labored breathing in hot and humid weather. Kind but courageous, friendly but dignified, the Bulldog is a thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser whose “sourmug” face is the universal symbol of courage and tenacity. These docile, loyal companions adapt well to town or country.","Friendly, Courageous, Calm",5,35.56,38.1,18.143694800000002,22.6796185,8.0,10.0,Non-Sporting Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.8,Regularly,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.6,Agreeable,0.8,Friendly
Bullmastiff,"The Bullmastiff isn’t quite as large as his close cousin the Mastiff. Still, standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 100 and 130 pounds, this is still a whole lot of dog. After the first impression made by the Bullmastiff’s size, it is the large, broad head that conveys the breed’s essence: the dark eyes, high-set V-shaped ears, and broad, deep muzzle all combine to present the intelligence, alertness, and confidence that make the Bullmastiff a world-class protector and family companion. Coats come in fawn, red, or brindle.These are biddable and reliable creatures, but as with any large guarding dog, owners must begin training and socialization early, while the puppy is still small enough to control. Fearless at work, docile at home, the Bullmastiff is a large, muscular guarder who pursued and held poachers in Merry Old England—merry, we suppose, for everyone but poachers.

The double coat is harsh and wiry on top and downy beneath. A Cairn presents as a small, shaggy, alert dog, with head, tail, and ears up, and eyes shining with intelligence.A British breed club promotes Cairns as the “best little pal in the world.” Cairns are small enough for a lap-top snuggle and sturdy enough for a good romp on the lawn. They do best with lots of close family contact. For owners who cherish the terrier qualities of gameness, independent thinking, and true-blue loyalty, no other breed will do. Cairn Terriers are happy, busy little earthdogs originally bred to fearlessly root out foxes and other small, furred prey in the rocky Scottish countryside. Curious and alert, Cairns like having a place where they can explore and dig.","Alert, Cheerful, Busy",69,24.13,25.4,5.8967008100000005,6.35029318,13.0,15.0,Terrier Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.4,Occasional,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.6,Agreeable,0.8,Friendly
Canaan Dog,"Canaan Dogs are lean, bushy-tailed dogs standing 19 to 24 inches at the shoulder. The coat is straight and harsh, and comes in various colors and patterns. Erect, expressive ears and dark almond eyes convey an inquisitive expression. Canaans move at a brisk, natural trot. They are rugged, agile, and apparently tireless, making them a nice fit for hikers and runners.Canaans are clever, confident, and territorial. They will end up “owning” passive owners who haven’t establish themselves as top dog in the family pack. Early training and socialization are key. When positive methods are applied, these ancient wonder-dogs train beautifully. Agility, obedience, herding trials, and sentry duty are a few outlets for their work ethic.

Cane Corso,"At nearly 28 inches at the shoulder and often weighing more than 100 pounds, with a large head, alert expression, and muscles rippling beneath their short, stiff coat, Corsi are at a glance intimidating creatures. Their imposing appearance is their first line of defense against intruders. As one writer put it, “An understated air of cool competence, the kind of demeanor you’d expect from a professional bodyguard, is the breed’s trademark.”Corsi are intelligent, loyal, eager to please, versatile, and intensely loyal to their humans, but are also assertive and willful, and can end up owning an unwitting owner. As with any other big guardian dog, responsible breeding and early socialization with people and other dogs is vital. Smart, trainable, and of noble bearing, the assertive and confident Cane Corso is a peerless protector. The Corso’s lineage goes back to ancient Roman times, and the breed’s name roughly translates from the Latin as “bodyguard dog.”","Affectionate, Intelligent, Majestic",32,59.69,69.85,0.0,0.0,9.0,12.0,Working Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.4,Occasional,0.8,Energetic,0.6,Agreeable,0.6,Alert/Responsive

The quickest way to distinguish Cardis from their cousins, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, is to check out the hindquarters: Cardigans have tails; Pembrokes do not.Cardis are trainable, faithful, and vigilant guardians with a “big dog” bark. Well-socialized Cardis are especially fond of kids and agreeable with other pets. These athletic, rugged herders have a love for the outdoors, and they thrive on mental stimulation and physical activity.

Carolina Dog,"Carolina dogs are descended from the canines that accompanied the Paleo-Indians who traveled from Asia to North America over the Bering land bridge. Today, they can still be found living wild near the Georgia-South Carolina border, but have also been seen as far north as Ohio and Pennsylvania and as far west as Arizona; rural areas are the common denominator. The typical Carolina dog has pointed ears, a fox-like snout and a tail that curves like a fishhook when it is raised. They look similar to Australian Dingoes but, taxonomically, they fall under canis familiaris. Hesitant with strangers, they will sound the alarm when unaware of who’s at the door, but once they see their people, they are ecstatic.

Chihuahua,"The Chihuahua is a balanced, graceful dog of terrier-like demeanor, weighing no more than 6 pounds. The rounded “apple” head is a breed hallmark. The erect ears and full, luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats come in many colors and patterns, and can be long or short. The varieties are identical except for coat.Chihuahuas possess loyalty, charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, and without it this clever scamp will rule your household like a little Napoleon. Compact and confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets. They are too small for roughhousing with kids, and special care must be taken in cold weather, but Chihuahuas are adaptable—as long as they get lots of quality time in their preferred lap. The Chihuahua is a tiny dog with a huge personality. A national symbol of Mexico, these alert and amusing ""purse dogs"" stand among the oldest breeds of the Americas, with a lineage going back to the ancient kingdoms of pre-Columbian times.","Charming, Graceful, Sassy",33,12.7,20.32,2.7215542200000002,2.7215542200000002,14.0,16.0,Toy Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.4,Occasional,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.4,Independent,0.6,Alert/Responsive
Chinese Crested,"The Chinese Crested, a lively and alert toy breed standing between 11 and 13 inches high, can be hairless or coated. The hairless variety has smooth, soft skin and tufts of hair on the head, tail, and ankles. The coated variety, called the “powderpuff,” is covered by a soft, silky coat. Besides the coat, there’s very little difference between the powderpuff and his undressed brother. Both varieties are characterized by fine-boned elegance and graceful movement.Cresteds are as fun as they look: playful, loving, and devoted to their humans. The hairless has its advantages: there is no doggy odor, and for obvious reasons shedding isn’t much of a problem. Both varieties are attentive housemates, totally in tune with their family. With their spotted pink skin, spiky “crested” hairdo, furry socks and feathery tail, you can’t mistake the sweet and slender Chinese Crested for any other breed.

Chinese Shar-Pei,"The compact, medium-sized Chinese Shar-Pei is an amalgam of odd physical traits: a broad “hippopotamus” muzzle; a blue-black tongue; small, sunken eyes with a scowling expression; tiny triangular ears; abundant folds of loose skin about the head, neck, and shoulders; the tapered high-set tail—all blanketed by a harsh, sandpapery coat. (A literal translation of Shar-Pei: “sand skin.”)Shar-Pei are strong, regal, independent guardians famous for intelligence and loyalty. They are suspicious of strangers and other dogs. Shar-Pei are serene dogs, but they will meet a perceived threat with tenacity and vigor. Early training and socialization are essential—a dominant adult Shar-Pei without them is a serious problem waiting to happen. This fascinating but challenging breed of ancient pedigree is steadfastly loyal to family, but standoffish with strangers. The Chinese Shar-Pei has physical characteristics that make him a one-of-a-kind companion and guardian dog.","Loyal, Independent, Calm",64,45.72,50.8,20.41165665,27.2155422,8.0,12.0,Non-Sporting Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.8,Regularly,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.2,May be Stubborn,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Chinook,"Tawny-coated, no-frills Chinooks are muscular and substantial, with males standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder. Females, with their distinctly feminine look, are a bit smaller.

They are the picture of stouthearted dignity, with a kindly twinkle in their dark, almond eyes.Chinooks are calm, people-oriented dogs with a special feel for children. They are trainable workers who aim to please. Sledding, carting, obedience, agility, search-and-rescue work, and herding are a few pursuits they’ve mastered. Chinooks are not particularly busy dogs, but they need consistent exercise to stay in proper hard condition.

Their distinctive traits include a lion’s-mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have rough or smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream.Owners say Chows are the cleanest of dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as cats.

Cirneco dell’Etna,"Standing under 20 inches, the Cirneco (“cheer-NEK-o”; Cirnechi is the plural) is often described as resembling a smaller version of the Pharaoh Hound, its cousin from the island of Malta. This slender but rugged hunter’s coat ranges from light to dark tan or chestnut. The large, upright ears point up the alert expression of the eyes, whose amber or ochre color smartly complements the coat.In many ways, these lithe and leggy Sicilians are typical sighthounds: sweet-natured, independent and, of course, breathtakingly swift. It is said, though, that Cirnechi are a bit more trainable than the usual sighthound. These living artifacts of antiquity have sprinted into the 21st century relatively unchanged by passing fads and fancies. The sleek and sinewy Cirneco dell’Etna, the ancient coursing hound of Sicily, is an athletic hunter given to quick bursts of speed.

The dense coat is primarily white, with sparse lemon or orange markings.Clumbers are sweet and easygoing at home, but these outdoorsy fellows can be relentless on scent.

He quoted the words written by Bishop Petar in 1374 and, providing his own description of the dog, stated that the Croatian Sheepdog had not changed since the record (from 1374 to 1719) and had not changed in appearance from that described by Bishop Petar in 1374.A systematic selection breeding program was started by the “father of the breed” – veterinarian Prof Dr Stjepan Romic in 1935 with dogs in the territory of Djakovo.

Although it is not a widely known breed, the Dutch Shepherd is a loyal companion and competent working dog used for obedience, dog sports, herding, tracking, search and rescue, and as a police dog. The Dutch Shepherd is a lively, athletic, alert and intelligent breed, and has retained its herding instinct for which it was originally developed.

English Foxhound,"The English Foxhound is the epitome of what serious dog breeders strive for: beauty, balance, and utility. “Next to an old Greek statue,” a poet wrote, “there are few such combinations of grace and strength as in a fine Foxhound.”These pack-oriented, scent-driven hounds are gentle and sociable, but rarely seen as house pets. They can be so driven by a primal instinct for pursuit that not much else, including training, matters to them. Owning these noble creatures is best left to huntsmen who kennel packs of hounds or to those experienced in meeting the special challenges of life with swift, powerful hounds hardwired for the chase. The English Foxhound is a substantial galloping hound of great stamina. His long legs are straight as a gatepost, and just as sturdy. The back is perfectly level. And the chest is very deep, “girthing” as much as 31 inches on a hound measuring 24 inches at the shoulder, ensuring plenty of lung power for a grueling day’s hunt.","Affectionate, Gentle, Sociable",188,60.96,60.96,27.2155422,34.01942775,10.0,13.0,Hound Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.8,Regularly,0.8,Energetic,0.6,Agreeable,0.8,Friendly

In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a “merry action.”The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth’s great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.

The stamina and courage of these longer-than-tall hunters is the stuff of Gallic legend. The Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen is a French scenthound.

Great Dane,"As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs—and when standing on their hind legs, they are taller than most people. These powerful giants are the picture of elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. The coat comes in different colors and patterns, perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as “harlequin.”Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those foolish enough to mistake the breed’s friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit. Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily. The easygoing Great Dane, the mighty “Apollo of Dogs,” is a total joy to live with—but owning a dog of such imposing size, weight, and strength is a commitment not to be entered into lightly.

Greyhound,"Greyhounds are the essence of the dog breeder’s credo “Form follows function.” From the narrow, aerodynamic skull to the shock-absorbing pads of the feet, Greyhounds are perfectly constructed for high-speed pursuit. The lean beauty of the Greyhound’s “inverted S” shape, created by the deep chest curving gently into a tightly tucked waist, has been an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings for as long as human beings have called themselves civilized. Greyhounds are the template from which other coursing hounds have been struck.

Hamiltonstovare,"Hamiltonstovare are most commonly multi-purpose dogs; they are hunters, show dogs, and pets, all in one regal and versatile little package. As a hound, they follow their nose wherever it goes (and will not return for a good long while), so leashes and fences are a necessity with this breed. Unlike most scent hounds though, the Hamiltonstovare has an extremely high prey drive for both scent and sight. They can make excellent lure coursing dogs. In the home, they are a lazy, low maintenance dog who rarely sheds. Very food motivated, they can be easy to train despite their hound stubbornness, but higher competitive obedience levels are not usually an option. The only major problem with this breed is accessibility; there is only one breeder of Hamiltonstovare in the United States. Unfortunately, Hamiltonstovare have a rescue problem in the US as well, and some can be found in rural shelters in Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee.

His broad, deep chest provides ample room for the lungs and enables long, strenuous chases. The slightly wrinkled forehead and the clear, dark eyes produce the serious expression typical of the Hanoverian Scenthound. Also typical for the breed is the red primary color of the coat, which can vary from a pale fawn color to a dark brindle, appearing almost black.

The breed comes in several colors: white, red, black, brindle, sesame, and wolf grey. With early training, the Hokkaido is a very loyal and dedicated companion who wants to please his human family. They are incredibly intelligent thinkers and problem solvers, and they excel at tasks given to them. If not socialized properly, however, Hokkaido can become wary of strangers and protective of their families. The breed is extremely rare outside its native country. In Japan, there is an estimated population of around 10,000-12,000, and yearly registrations of between 900-1000. The Hokkaido is a dog of noteworthy endurance and dignity.

They are alert, faithful, trustworthy, extremely intelligent, fun-loving, and stubborn. A Hovawart likes to have a job to do, or he will use his creative nature to find one. They take approximately two years to mature. Currently, Hovawarts in North America are participating in search and rescue organizations, therapy dog activities, obedience trials, agility trials, flyball and service dog training. Owning a Hovawart can be quite a challenge, and they require significant time and attention from their owners, so they are not recommended for first-time dog owners. However, for an owner who is willing to expend the effort to teach their dog appropriate behaviors in different situations, the reward is a faithful companion. The Hovawart is a family dog. It develops a strong bond to its “pack” and must be a part of the family life; it needs to bond closely with the owner/family.

Newfoundland,"A male Newfoundland can weigh up to 150 pounds and stand 28 inches at the shoulder; females typically go 100 to 120 pounds. The Newf head is majestic, the expression soft and soulful. The outer coat is flat and coarse. Colors are gray, brown, black, and a black-and-white coat named for artist Sir Edwin Landseer, who popularized the look in his paintings.The Newfie breed standard says that a sweet temperament is the “most important single characteristic of the breed.” The Newf’s sterling character is expressed in their affinity for kids. Trusting and trainable, Newfs respond well to gentle guidance. These noble giants are among the world’s biggest dogs, and acquiring a pet that could outweigh you comes with obvious challenges. The massive Newfoundland is a strikingly large, powerful working dog of heavy bone and dignified bearing. The sweet-tempered Newfie is a famously good companion and has earned a reputation as a patient and watchful “nanny dog” for kids.","Sweet, Patient, Devoted",40,66.04,71.12,45.359237,68.0388555,9.0,10.0,Working Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.8,Easy Training,0.8,Friendly
Norfolk Terrier,"Norfolk Terriers are among the smallest working terriers, standing no higher than 10 inches at the shoulder. The coat is hard, wiry, and straight. They share many traits with their close cousins, Norwich Terriers. To tell them apart, look at the ears: The Norwich has erect, pointed ears; Norfolk ears are neatly folded over.Bred to work in packs, Norfolks are more gregarious than a typical terrier, but they have plenty of the old terrier pep. Few Norfolks these days earn their living hunting rodents, but a good one will fearlessly do so when given a chance. Norfolks bond closely, sometimes jealously, with their owners and make nice watchdogs. They have a reputation as a good traveler: portable, adaptable, and up for anything. Norfolk Terriers are little, cute, and loyal, and they will gladly curl up in your lap, but don’t dare call them lapdogs. Norfolks, despite their toyish qualities, are genuine terriers—feisty, confident, sturdy, and game for adventure.","Fearless, Alert, Fun-Loving",126,22.86,25.4,4.9895160700000005,5.4431084400000005,12.0,16.0,Terrier Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.6,Agreeable,0.8,Friendly
Norrbottenspets,"Nobs aren’t large dogs (a big male stands a shade below 20 inches) but their tough, sinewy bodies are built to withstand punishing terrain and harsh climates. They are a small-sized hunting dog of Spitz-type, which was thought to be extinct but survived as a farm and hunting dog in the Northern parts of Sweden and Finland. To be able to navigate the rough terrain and climate of the Scandinavian forests and hold large dangerous game, like moose, Norrbottenspets evolved to be extremely agile, rugged, and weatherproof with a fearless attitude, while at the same time kind and affectionate companions at home. They exhibit no extremes in physical characteristics because they must do all things well. The Norrbottenspets is a small, slightly rectangular spitzdog, well poised, with sinewy and well-developed muscles. Alert with head carried high, they have a fearless attitude and are extremely agile. They are calm, keen, and attentive, with a kind disposition.","Fearless, Agile, Attentive",,41.910000000000004,45.72,9.071847400000001,13.6077711,14.0,17.0,Miscellaneous Class,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.4,Occasional,0.8,Energetic,,,,
Norwegian Buhund,"The Buhund, a prototypical spitz, provides a good opportunity to explain the term. Spitz are cold-weather breeds characterized by a dense coat, a tail curved tightly over the back, a wedge-shaped head, and erect, pointed ears (“spitz” means “pointed” in ancient German). They can be pint-sized like Pomeranians, mighty like Malamutes, or mid-sized like the lithe but sturdy Buhund. Males can stand 18.5 inches high and weight up to 40 pounds. Coat colors are wheaten or black. The densely coated Norwegian Buhund, a Nordic spitz-type closely associated with the Vikings, is a medium-sized cold-weather worker adept at herding and guarding. As family dogs, Buhunds are smart, affectionate, and steadfastly devoted.","Confident, Smart, Perceptive",165,40.64,46.99,11.793401620000001,18.143694800000002,12.0,15.0,Herding Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.8,Easy Training,0.8,Friendly
Norwegian Elkhound,"Norwegian Elkhounds are hardy, short-bodied dogs standing about 20 inches at the shoulder. They have a dense silver-gray coat and a tail curling tightly over the back. The deep chest, sturdy legs, and muscular thighs belong to a dog built for an honest day’s work. The eyes are a dark brown and the ears mobile and erect. Overall, an Elkhound is the picture of an alert and steadfast dog of the north.Elkhounds are famously fine companions and intelligent watchdogs. Agility and herding trials are good outlets for their natural athleticism and eagerness. Reserved until introductions are made, an Elkhound is a trustworthy friend ever after. These strong, confident dogs are truly sensitive souls, with a dash of houndy independence. The Norwegian Elkhound is a robust spitz type known for his lush silver-gray coat and dignified but friendly demeanor. The durable Elkhound is among Europe's oldest dogs.

Norwegian Lundehund,"At a glance, Lundehunds seem a typical northern breed: A spitz type with triangular ears, curving tail, and a dense double coat. But a closer look reveals several unique traits. They have feet with at least six fully functioning toes and extra paw pads, an “elastic neck” that can crane back so the head touches the spine, ears that fold shut, and flexible shoulders that allow forelegs to extend to the side, perpendicular to the body. This last anomaly produces the breed’s distinctive “rotary” gait. From Norway’s rocky island of Vaeroy, the uniquely constructed Norwegian Lundehund is the only dog breed created for the job of puffin hunting. With puffins now a protected species, today’s Lundehund is a friendly, athletic companion.","Loyal, Energetic, Alert",191,30.48,38.1,9.071847400000001,13.6077711,12.0,15.0,Non-Sporting Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.6,Agreeable,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Norwich Terrier,"Standing no more than 10 inches at the shoulder and weighing about 12 pounds, Norwich are among the smallest working terriers. Beneath the hard, wiry coat is a stocky, substantial dog. Norwiches are toy-sized but are not satin-pillow dogs—they were originally bred as tough and fearless ratters. They are distinguished from their doggy doppelganger, the Norfolk Terrier, by their erect, pointed ears.Happy-go-lucky, fearless, and sometimes even bossy, Norwiches are energetic enough to play fetch all day, but affectionate enough to enjoy hours of lap time with their favorite human. Short, positive training sessions work best with this clever but sometimes stubborn breed. Three words convey the overall dog: cute, cuter, and cutest. Norwich Terriers are plucky little earthdogs named for their hometown in England. The old cliché “a big dog in a small package” was coined for breeds like the Norwich, who can be oblivious to the fact that they are just 10 inches tall.","Affectionate, Alert, Curious",108,25.4,25.4,5.4431084400000005,5.4431084400000005,12.0,15.0,Terrier Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.6,Agreeable,0.8,Friendly
Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever,"The little gundog with the big name is the smallest AKC retriever, standing ideally 18 or 19 inches at the shoulder. The Toller’s trademark is a coat of stunning crimson, ranging from golden red to a dark coppery color, with white markings. Strong and agile, Tollers are medium dogs: medium in size, bone, and coat length. The almond-shaped eyes project an alert expression.Tollers are upbeat athletes who require outlets for their boundless vigor: hunting, hiking, camping, and, of course, swimming (for which they are ideally suited, down to their webbed feet). Tollers are smart, handsome, affectionate companions, but these red tornadoes can be recommended only to those with enough time and energy to keep them usefully occupied. The smallest of the AKC’s retrievers, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is intelligent, affectionate, and eager to please. Play fetch with a tireless Toller until your right arm falls off, and he will ask you to throw left-handed.","Affectionate, Intelligent, Outgoing",83,43.18,53.34,15.875732950000002,22.6796185,12.0,14.0,Sporting Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,1.0,Needs Lots of Activity,0.8,Easy Training,0.8,Friendly
Old English Sheepdog,"Beneath the Old English Sheepdog’s profuse double coat is a muscular and compact drover, with plenty of bone and a big rump, standing 21 or 22 inches at the shoulder. Their eyes (when you can see them) are dark brown, or blue, or one of each. The OES breed standard says the skull is “capacious and rather squarely formed, giving plenty of room for brain power.”OES move with a bear-like shuffle but are famous for their nimbleness afoot. Regular exercise is required for these strong, able-bodied workers. Equally famed are their many fine housedog qualities: watchfulness, courage, kindliness, and intelligence. Great with children, OES make patient, protective playmates. They are sensible watchdogs known for a loud, ringing bark. The Old English Sheepdog is the archetypical shaggy dog, famous for his profuse coat and peak-a-boo hairdo, a distinctive bear-like gait, and a mellow, agreeable nature.

Otterhound,"These big, bouncy hounds were ideally suited for otter hunting. OHs are built to be expert swimmers, from the top of their rough, waterproof coat to the bottom of their big webbed feet. A broad chest and powerful shoulders allow them to swim all day without tiring. Their large black nose is amazingly sensitive and could follow an otter’s underwater scent trail over great distances. And the OH’s size and strength enabled them to take on a sharp-toothed, razor-clawed otter that might weigh 20 pounds. Big, boisterous, and affectionate, the Otterhound was bred in medieval England for the now-outlawed activity of otter hunting. This scarce breed is known for his dense shaggy coat, webbed feet, acute sense of smell, and affinity for swimming.","Even-Tempered, Amiable, Boisterous",182,60.96,68.58,36.287389600000004,52.163122550000004,10.0,13.0,Hound Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.2,May be Stubborn,0.6,Alert/Responsive
Papillon,"A tiny dog, measuring 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder, you can still spot a Papillon a block away thanks to the large, wing-shaped ears that give the breed its name (“papillon” is French for “butterfly”). Some Paps have erect ears; in others, known as the Phalene type, the ears are down. Paps are dainty and elegant, with a plumed tail, and a long, silky coat of several color combinations, the base color being white. More robust than they look, Paps are little dogs for all seasons and reasons. They thrive in warm or cool climates, in town or country, and are eager to join family fun. They are excellent agility dogs and are consistent winners at the sport’s highest levels; less ambitious owners can train them to do all kinds of tricks. The quick, curious Papillon is a toy dog of singular beauty and upbeat athleticism. Despite his refined appearance, the Pap is truly a “doggy dog” blessed with a hardy constitution. Papillon fanciers describe their breed as happy, alert, and friendly.","Friendly, Alert, Happy",54,20.32,27.94,2.2679618500000003,4.535923700000001,14.0,16.0,Toy Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,1.0,Eager to Please,1.0,Outgoing
Parson Russell Terrier,"PRTs stand 12–15 inches at the shoulder, and weigh 13–17 pounds when in peak condition. Their intelligent expression, mostly white coat, and beautifully balanced body give PRTs the adorable looks of a plush toy come to life. But don’t be fooled by all that cuteness—PRTs are tough little guys built for England’s traditional sport of foxhunting. They’re fast enough to follow the hounds and fearless enough to dig into the ground and flush a fox from his lair.

Pekingese,"Pekingese are compact, stocky toy dogs weighing up to 14 pounds. The coat is longest at the neck and shoulders, giving Pekes their famous “lion’s mane.” Coats come in various reds, from a golden-red to darker shades. The large, short-muzzled head is a wider-than-long “envelope shaped” rectangle, and the eyes are large, dark, and sparkly. A unique feature of Pekes is their effortless “rolling” gait.Pekes are charming, confident companions who develop a tight bond with their favorite human. Bred to live in palaces, they can be as serenely independent as the emperors who owned them. (They’re “opinionated,” Peke people say.) Ever alert, they make good watchdogs. Pekes will tolerate kids but won’t stand for a lot of roughhousing. The Pekingese, a compact toy companion of regal bearing and a distinctive rolling gait, is one of several breeds created for the ruling classes of ancient China.

They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings.The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses and a “big dog” bark.

Peruvian Inca Orchid,"These affectionate companion dogs are essentially sighthounds (think Greyhounds and Whippets) and have the same elegant contours of their racy cousins. PIOs come in a range of sizes: the smallest might stand just short of 10 inches; the largest top out at nearly 26 inches. Their distinguishing feature is, of course, hairlessness. The delicate skin can be a solid color or spotted with unpigmented areas. Coated PIOs are in the minority, and the coated and hairless varieties can occur in the same littler.Going by his general conformation, it is an elegant and slim dog, whose aspect expresses speed, strength and harmony without ever appearing coarse. Another particular feature is that the dentition in the hairless variety is nearly always incomplete, associated with the congenital alopecia. Noble and affectionate at home with those close to him, he is at the same time lively and alert. He might be wary of strangers and is a good watch dog. The breed is loyal and protective of his family, but like all dogs, should be supervised around younger children. Caution should also be taken with small pets that may be seen as prey.

Porcelaine,"Elegant, proud, graceful, cat-like and stunningly gorgeous, the Porcelaine is never shy or timid and always eager for a pat on the head or a hug. His nature makes him an excellent candidate for medical therapy, medical alert, medical service, police public relations, and search and rescue.

That said, you must remember that any breed with a high prey drive will require careful consideration in housing and handling. Another charming aspect of the breed is that they tend to be quiet indoors or in their kennel, but do have a beautiful melodious baying call. They are not nuisance barkers. The Porcelaine is elegant, energetic, and a fierce hunter; he is used for small game, driving it to waiting guns. He is very fond of his owners, family, friends and children and he loves to take part in all family activities.

Portuguese Podengo,"The Podengo is a rugged coursing hound that comes in two sizes: medio (medium, standing 16 to 22 inches at the shoulder) and grande (large, 22 to 28 inches). They also have two coat types: smooth and wirehaired. The breed’s enthusiasts describe it as “primitive,” that is, it’s a rustic, no-frills hound untouched by fads and fashion since arriving on the Iberian Peninsula ages ago. Among their distinctive characteristics are large, erect, triangular ears; a pyramid-shaped head that tapers to the nose; and sweetly expressive, almond-shaped eyes.Podengos, in general, are funny dogs that love to play. They easily entertain themselves with toys, chase each other and stalk each other around the house and yard. They are highly intelligent and learn new things very fast. Since they are a watchful dog though, they are not as easy going and playful with strangers and may view smaller animals like dogs and cats as prey. They may be quite reserved initially and prefer to greet strangers on their own terms. They are very tolerant and compliant, eager to please their family members and put up with most requests we make of them. Portuguese Podengos are lively, agile, playful, alert, highly intelligent but not always easy to train, independent yet loving with the family and sometimes suspicious of strangers. The breed's two sizes have different jobs: the larger hunts deer and boar and the medium-sized hunts rabbit. In the U.S, they are successful in coursing, agility, nose work, barn hunt, rally and in the conformation ring.","Independent, Alert, Intelligent",,40.64,71.12,15.875732950000002,29.937096420000003,10.0,12.0,Miscellaneous Class,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.8,Regularly,0.8,Energetic,0.6,Agreeable,0.4,Reserved with Strangers

With his coat of corkscrew curls, circular tail, expressive ears, and distinctively whimsical look, the Pumi is all kinds of cute. But beneath the curls is a lean, deep-chested herder with a seemingly endless capacity for work and play.

Pyrenean Mastiff,"The Pyrenean Mastiff is friendly towards humans, calm, noble and very intelligent. At the same time, he is courageous and proud towards strangers, from whom he never backs away. In his behavior towards other dogs, he is good-natured and aware of his superior strength. Though he will do his job to alert when strangers or animals come around, he is not known for being an incessant barker. As a guardian breed, the Pyrenean Mastiff has a very low prey drive and, therefore, loves and protects all creatures, human and animal alike. They love children and welcome friends and family, and only feel the need to protect when its a real threat.

Ridgebacks also have two nose colors: black and the less commonly seen brown.The formidable Ridgeback can be strong willed, independent, and sometimes domineering. Ridgebacks must be guided with a firm but fair hand from puppyhood. They are faithful friends, protective of their loved ones and meltingly affectionate with those whom they trust. Still, a Ridgeback can be too much hound for the novice dog owner. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is an all-purpose “Renaissance hound” whose hallmark is the ridge, or stripe of backward-growing hair, on his back.

It is a large dog with long coat which requires regular grooming, and with any dog of this size and temperament requires daily exercise and basic obedience training.Mioritics are lively and stubborn but in spite of all their independence they are very sensitive creatures in their furry armor. As puppies they stick to the pack which has accepted them. This can be any kind of creature – dog, cat, horse, sheep, the Mioritic needs very close family ties; a house without doors it thinks would be ideal. This certainly depends a great deal on the weather. Its favorite place is always very close to its favorite person. It determines its resting place itself. This may even be the couch or a carpet not suitable for dogs, but as a rule shepherds, even as puppies, prefer to sleep on hard ground. They need no dog baskets, no special mattresses and by no means an allocated place. No “work creating” program is necessary but daily walks and hikes provide exciting variation. The Romanian Mioritic Shepherd Dog origins come from near the Carpathian Mountains.

They thrive on human companionship and will let you know if they are feeling neglected. Their coat is either semi-long or smooth. The longhaired variety carries a nice ruff on the chest and unique feathering on the extremities, tail and ears. Long-coated Russian Toys will not have an adult coat until it is more than a year old and full fringing not until three years of age. The smooth-coated variety is sleek and smooth to the touch.

Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs.

Stabyhoun,"The Stabyhoun’s independent nature was a deliberately bred characteristic by farmers who wanted a dog that could hunt independently for moles and rabbits. That propensity we still see today, therefore, you cannot be upset if he looks for prey independently and, for example, digs in the garden. With proper guidance, a Staby is a gentle dog and a great friend for life.Stabys are also very inquisitive. Always pay attention to what a Stabyhoun is up to because with their inquisitive nature, they can quickly get into trouble. If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no “surprises” in store before calming down again.This breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands. The majority of Stabyhouns are black and white. The brown and white coloring is seen in the Netherlands, but the orange and white Stabyhoun is nearly extinct. The Staby’s build is such that it is greater in length than in height and similarly, the head shows more length than width. The feathering on his chest, collar, forelegs, trousers and tail gives the Staby the impression of being longhaired, but the coat is not excessively long. The Stabyhoun is considered to be an “all-around” dog, with abilities in hunting, retrieving, and pointing. They are also ideal family dogs because of their size and affectionate character.

Swedish Vallhund,"With their thick sable coat, sturdy construction, and overall no-frills look, Vallhunds are a timeless breed, as comfortable in a suburban backyard as they were on the prow of Viking longships 1,200 years ago. These lively herders are built long and low to the ground—in not quite as exaggerated a fashion as their distant cousins the corgis, but the idea is the same: Their build makes it easier to nip at the heels of cattle and avoid kicks to the head. Balance, power, and smooth movement are breed hallmarks. The long and low Swedish Vallhund, Viking Dog of ancient legend, is a smart and sociable herder of dense coat and boundless energy. These rugged cattle dogs are known for their zest for life, unique vocalizations, and cheerful demeanor.","Friendly, Energetic, Watchful",169,29.21,34.925,9.071847400000001,15.875732950000002,12.0,15.0,Herding Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.6,Seasonal,1.0,Needs Lots of Activity,1.0,Eager to Please,0.8,Friendly
Taiwan Dog,"The Taiwan Dog’s intuitive nature and connection to its master were most likely honed from generations of collaboratively hunting small game in the mountains. This also means that they are extremely responsive to commands and easily trained. This breed can be reserved towards strangers and are fearless in protecting their family. Therefore, socialization for the Taiwan Dog is necessary to mediate its strong instinct to protect its master and family. They should be an integral part of the family household and not an outside dog as they excel with daily interaction and socialization.

Teddy Roosevelt Terrier,"Teddy Roosevelt Terriers are delightful companions in the home. They learn quickly and are ready for any activity their owners engage in. While they will still keep the family farm and home free of rats and mice, the job for which they were bred, they also excel in companion sports such as agility and obedience. They get along with other dogs without belligerence and have retained their prey drive without obsessive compulsion. At the end of the day, they love nothing better than to share the love and companionship of their owners. Teddies can adapt to pretty much any lifestyle, whether you show in conformation rings, work in agility trials, or just want a great companion for your home or farm. Their small to medium size make them suitable to apartment living as well. This loyal, active and playful breed is at its best as a member of its human family.

Thai Ridgeback,"The Thai Ridgeback is a muscular, medium-sized dog with a streamlined body that makes him very agile and a natural athlete. The ridge on his back is formed by hair growing in the opposite direction from the rest of his coat and the breed has up to 8 different ridge patterns. Puppies can be born without this ridge. Coat colors include solid blue, black, red or fawn with a black mask occasionally on the red-coated dogs. Thai Ridgebacks also have spotted tongues and some even come with solid black/blue tongues. Today, most Ridgebacks are companion dogs, but they still maintain many of the same instincts for the jobs for which they were bred: hunting and guarding. They had to be independent, self-sufficient and hunt for their own food, which gave them strong survival instincts, a high prey drive, and a high level of intelligence.If well bred and properly socialized, the Thai Ridgeback can be a loyal, loving pet. As a guarding breed, they are naturally protective of their home and can be reserved and suspicious with strangers. Thai Ridgebacks will need a patient, consistent, and experienced owner with a good understanding of dog behavior; they are not for first-time dog owners.

Tibetan Mastiff,"Coming face to face with this ancient behemoth, an intruder up to no good will likely move on to easier pickings. TMs can stand 26 inches at the shoulder and weigh well over 100 pounds. It’s impossible to discuss this breed without leaning on words like “powerful,” “muscular,” “massive,” and “substantial.” And yet, TMs are quite light-footed and will meet a perceived threat with surprising agility. The broad head, with its high-set, V-shaped ears and expressive brown eyes, projects a noble, sagacious expression. Watchful, aloof, imposing, and intimidating: The ancient Tibetan Mastiff is the guardian dog supreme. These densely-coated giants are mellow and calm around the house, sweetly devoted to family, and aloof and territorial with strangers.","Independent, Reserved, Intelligent",131,60.96,66.04,31.751465900000003,68.0388555,10.0,12.0,Working Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.4,Independent,0.6,Alert/Responsive
Tibetan Spaniel,"With a blunt muzzle and big expressive eyes, a “lion’s mane” around the neck, and a plumed tail elegantly curving over the back, they’re distinctly Tibetan. But are they spaniels? No, not in the Western sense, like Cockers or Cavaliers. Instead, Tibbies recall the ancient traditions that produced Pekes, Pugs, Lhasas, and other unmistakably Asian breeds. Tibbies stand about 10 inches at the shoulder; they move quickly and with purpose. They’re seen in coats of many colors and combinations. The frisky and curious Tibetan Spaniel was bred ages ago for sentinel work on the walls of Tibetan monasteries. Known for a flat, silky coat and “lion’s mane” around the neck, the Tibbie forms a tight, worshipful bond with their humans.","Playful, Bright, Self-Confident",119,25.4,25.4,4.082331330000001,6.80388555,12.0,15.0,Non-Sporting Group,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.4,Calm,0.6,Agreeable,0.6,Alert/Responsive
Tibetan Terrier,"Bearing a passing resemblance to their smaller cousin, the Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Terriers reside at the lower end of medium-sized breeds, standing about 15 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 20 and 24 pounds. A breed hallmark is the beautiful and profuse double coat—wooly underneath, with a long, fine topcoat. TTs are unique among dogs for their large, flat “snowshoe” feet, adapted over centuries to help them negotiate the snowy, mountainous terrain of their homeland. The Tibetan Terrier, “Holy Dog of Tibet,” is an ancient watchdog and companion long associated with Buddhist monasteries. A profusely coated, small-to-medium-sized dog with “snowshoe” feet, the TT is affectionate, sensitive, and clever.","Affectionate, Loyal, Sensitive",96,35.56,43.18,8.164662660000001,13.6077711,15.0,16.0,Non-Sporting Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.4,Independent,0.4,Reserved with Strangers
Tornjak,"The Tornjak is also known as the Bosnian and Herzegovinian – Croatian Shepherd dog. He is a large and powerful dog, well-proportioned and agile. The shape of his body is almost square. When standing and moving, he is strong, harmonious and well-balanced. His coat is long and thick. According to studies, the Tornjak is most likely a descendant of the Tibetan Mastiff, or from the area where modern-day Iran is. That environment has created a healthy and strong watchdog, with modest needs for food and shelter. Tornjaks are friendly with people, but aggressive towards other animals and dogs that threaten his owner, home, sheep, pen or flock. They like to work and take commands readily from their owners. The Tornjak is of steady disposition, friendly, courageous, obedient, intelligent, and full of dignity and self-confidence.

Tosa,"The Tosa is quietly affectionate with his own family, but may be somewhat aloof with strangers. This breed is also, by nature, watchful of other dogs and may react aggressively to dogs it considers intruders. Overtly aggressive behavior towards humans is uncharacteristic of the breed. Their short, dense coat can be fawn, red, apricot, black or brindle and they can also have white markings on their chest and feet. In addition, Tosas mature slowly and individual dogs may not reach their prime until as late as four years of age. This breed is the largest of all Japanese dog breeds. They are also known as the Tosa Ken, Tosa Dog, Tosa Token, Tosa Inu, Japanese Fighting Dog, and Japanese Mastiff. The Tosa's temperament is marked by patience, composure, boldness and courage.

Transylvanian Hound,"The Transylvanian Hound is an ancient Hungarian hunter created by special climate, terrain and hunting conditions. His whole appearance reflects nobility and harmony. Due to his medium-size, his body is athletic, lean, muscular, and exaggerated, and his movement is balanced and elegant. Its basic nature is calm, balanced yet firm, temperamental and adaptable. Their playful nature makes them an ideal family favorite. Because of their balance and friendliness, they can be kept both in an apartment or house. His courage and loyalty make him a good guard.This scent hound is a basic dog, but it can also be used for retrieval.

Brindle-colored, smaller in size, and with a shorter ear, they are different in conformation than the Plott.

Treeing Walker Coonhound,"Few things can quicken a coon hunter’s pulse like the sight of this swift, tricolored hound in full stride—the long, muscular legs, the powerful and propulsive hindquarters, and the streamlined frame all working to cover maximum ground with minimum effort.

The long, silky ears frame a facial expression that is sensitive and loving around the house and intense when at work. As a hunter expected to work closely with humans, Vizslas form a tight bond with their owners and hate to be left alone.Athletes of many talents, Vizslas excel at various sports and activities.

Welsh Springer Spaniel,"Standing between 17 and 19 inches at the shoulder, Welshies are described by their fans as being of “handy size”: bigger and stronger than Cocker Spaniels but smaller than English Springers.Welshies have two hallmarks that distinguish them from other spaniels: A uniquely tapered head and an eye-catching coat of bold red and white patterns. The beautiful coat isn’t just ornamental—it’s a waterproof, weatherproof, and thornproof suit that enables Welshies to show off their renowned versatility in all climates and on all terrains.

Welsh Terrier,"Sturdy, compact, and rugged, with a tight-fitting black-and-tan coat and a rectangular head featuring folded ears and a jaunty beard, Welsh are constructed along the classic lines of Britain’s long-legged terriers. They stand about 15 inches at the shoulder, a little larger than the Lakeland Terrier but much smaller than the mighty Airedale.All three breeds, however, share a family resemblance: An ancient breed called the Old English Black and Tan Terrier is thought to be the granddaddy of these and some other British terriers. The Welsh Terrier is as alert and spirited as any self-respecting terrier, but a bit calmer than most—“game, not quarrelsome,” as breed fanciers say.

West Highland White Terrier,"Standing 10 to 11 inches at the shoulder, with dark piercing eyes, compact body, and a carrot-shaped tail wagging with delight, the Westie’s looks are irresistible. Beneath the plush-toy exterior, though, is a true working terrier of gameness and courage. Bred to hunt rats and other underground rodents, Westies are surprisingly strong and tough. The all-white double coat is hard to the touch, not soft and fluffy.Alert and active, Westies exhibit traits of a plucky and self-reliant ratting terrier: They require no pampering, they will chase after anything that moves, and their independence can make training a challenge.

Whippets like a fenced yard to run in, but they do nicely in cozy apartments too—as long as they are exercised properly. Another plus for city dwellers: Whippets rarely bark.

Working Kelpie,"The overall appearance of the Working Kelpie is that of a medium-sized, lithe, active, strongly-muscled dog conveying the capability of untiring work. He has been successfully used to manage a variety of stock, including reindeer, goats, cattle and of course sheep. Kelpies in Sweden have gained police dog titles and have pulled sleds. They are also being widely used as search and rescue dogs.Kelpies need companionship. Though he can be content to stay for hours on the chain, he also needs to be with you for some time each day and needs exercise, walks or games with a ball or a stick. One cannot expect this dog, which has been bred to work, to stay outside the house without any mental or physical stimulation. Inevitably, he will set about looking for an occupation, which could include chasing cars, trying to ‘work’ them as he would control sheep. A Working Kelpie makes a fine family dog, gets along well with ‘his’ children and, because they are naturally gentle, almost all Working Kelpies live peaceably with other family pets. The Working Kelpie is extremely alert, eager and highly intelligent. He possesses an open, friendly, active but placid disposition with a good balance between keenness to work and ability to relax.

Yakutian Laika,"For centuries the Yakutian Laika was an irreplaceable and faithful assistant of a man in the conditions where the slightest demonstration of weakness was punished with death. It always received respectful attitude from its human family, which treated it as its member rather than a simple domestic animal. This means that it developed into a fabulous companion dog, devoted, lively and biddable. The breed is extremely gentle and considerate with children to whom it commonly establishes especially tight bonds. Nevertheless its friendly nature doesn’t exclude the necessity of a certain amount of socialization, preferably at an early age.The Yakutian Laika is slightly reserved with unknown people but in most cases it’s excited to acquire a new playmate. Human aggressiveness was considered by dogs’ breeders as a major fault and was meticulously eliminated from its characteristics. The breed is endowed with a very sensitive nose and ears, which make it a rather capable watchdog. However its barking is no more than a means to show its anticipation of the perspective of making a new acquaintance. This dog will most likely fail in the role of a guardian due to its friendly nature.Yakutian Laikas used to pull a narta (sled) in close collaboration with dozens of other dogs, so they’re quite accepting of other dogs. The breed surely prefers to have one or several constant canine companions and can be introduced with few issues to the household with a pre-existing dog, although it should be performed with necessary caution. The second primary duty of this breed was hunting and it preserves much of its prey drive. That’s why its communication with other small and average-sized animals should never go unsupervised. The Yakutian Laika will most likely get on with a home cat if they have been reared together. Yakutian Laikas are used for herding, pulling sleds and hunting. They were developed in ancient times for natives of Yakutia as indispensable assistants. This versatile dog will be happy by your side or participating in agility, coursing ability, herding or sledding.","Affectionate, Intelligent, Active",,53.34,58.42,18.143694800000002,24.947580350000003,10.0,12.0,Foundation Stock Service,0.4,Weekly Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.2,May be Stubborn,0.4,Reserved with Strangers

Tenacious, feisty, brave, and sometimes bossy, the Yorkie exhibits all the traits of a true terrier. Often named the most popular dog breed in various American cities, Yorkies pack lots of big-town attitude into a small but self-important package. They are favorites of urbanites the world over.Yorkies are long-lived and low-allergen (the coat is more like human hair than animal fur), and they make fine little watchdogs. This is a true “personality breed,” providing years of laughs, love, and close companionship. Beneath the dainty, glossy, floor-length coat of a Yorkshire Terrier beats the heart of a feisty, old-time terrier. Yorkies earned their living as ratters in mines and mills long before they became the beribboned lapdogs of Victorian ladies.","Affectionate, Sprightly, Tomboyish",10,17.78,20.32,3.17514659,3.17514659,11.0,15.0,Toy Group,1.0,Specialty/Professional,0.2,Infrequent,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.2,May be Stubborn,0.8,Friendly
